## Introduction
AISI 304 stainless steel is widely used in various applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. However, it poses challenges in machining due to its high toughness and work hardening characteristics. This project aims to optimize the machining parameters to improve surface quality and productivity during CNC turning operations.

## Objectives
- To conduct turning experiments under dry and wet machining conditions.
- To analyze the influence of cutting parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) on output parameters (surface roughness, cutting temperature, and tool wear).
- To optimize the cutting parameters for minimizing surface roughness, cutting temperature, and tool wear using the Taguchi method.
- To compare the performance of AISI 304 stainless steel under dry and wet cutting conditions.

## Methodology
1. **Material Selection**: AISI 304 stainless steel was chosen for the study.
2. **Machining Setup**: CNC turning operations were performed using tungsten carbide cutting tools.

3. **Experimental Design**: The Taguchi method was employed to design experiments with varying levels of cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut.
4. **Data Collection**: Surface roughness, temperature, and tool wear were measured after each machining cycle.
5. **Analysis**: The results were analyzed using Mean and ANOVA to determine the influence of machining parameters.

## Results
- The study revealed that cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut significantly affect the surface finish of AISI 304 stainless steel.
- Optimal conditions for dry turning were found to be lower depth of cut, medium higher feed rate, and lower cutting speed.
- In wet turning, the cutting speed was identified as the most influential variable on surface finish.
